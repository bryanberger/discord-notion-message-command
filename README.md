# Discord Notion Message Rewrite Command

Cloudflare Worker to find and rewrite notion links from `https://` to `notion://` to open directly in app rather than your browser.

> Currently notion:// links aren't clicakble in Discord, so this is not that useful currenly lol.

## Develop

This is the starter template for **Slshx**, a library for building strongly-typed
[Discord commands](https://discord.com/developers/docs/interactions/application-commands)
that run on [Cloudflare Workers](https://workers.cloudflare.com/), using a
React-inspired syntax.

See the [Slshx repository](https://github.com/mrbbot/slshx) for setup instructions.

Also, install [wranger](https://github.com/cloudflare/wrangler)
